The idea of this project is to make a simple yet robust data morpher. This will be used for later projects, 
so I figured I would post it here. 

Take the string abcdefghi and give it to this program and your response will range anywhere from
	
	hiehhigegigeifgegigegiebceieieiffeieieihfhi
	gigefdgehehefgfedgdedihigdd
	dedbdcbcbcdgdeffegeeddbabcbdeedefffgghgffifeefdedc
	bidgiciggdkkeieibfcieicbfghibfi
	dfdabbccddefdefdedfedfbefdecbbcecbcebdedbdeffedfdeceggghgifef
	fcdafgchfdfdfdfazfghfhfefhcfcfcfgccfcccfefhhfcccecgfhhgfgfegfi
	egdddegedefeddcbcdefgfgfgfedefeeddefgfeefgfefeeddefeeddefgfgfgfgfgfgfggfeeddefgfeeddefigf

There really is no clear corrilation between each of the seperate strings, however the within each string
there is a very clear pattern. 

This is the concept of the morph, you give it an initial data, and it will use that data to create 
something... morphed :)
